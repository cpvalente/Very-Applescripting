# Very Applescripting
(Very) simple applescript bits for running media installations.
Designed to work with iCal

I should really add a description of what the files do.
At some point... it is pretty self explanatory so far

Util
- Start Chrome in given page and toggle to fullscreen

VLC
- VLC Fullscreen
- VLC Play
- VLC Rewind Pause

I have also added some Terminal commands for common operations for show critical machines
