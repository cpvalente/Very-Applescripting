# Very Applescripting
(Very) simple applescript bits for running media installations.
Designed to work with iCal
THIS IS NOT AN INSTALLATION GUIDE BUT AN ARCHIVE FOR PREVIOUSLY USED SOLUTIONS

I should really add a description of what the files do.
At some point... it is pretty self explanatory so far

Util
- Start Chrome in given page and toggle to fullscreen

VLC
- VLC Fullscreen
- VLC Open in Fullscreen with check
- VLC Play
- VLC Rewind Pause

I have also added some Terminal commands for common operations for show critical machines

This is again very simple, could be worth to follow up with some topics
- Email yourself a screenshot on crash https://benjaminrojas.net/configuring-postfix-to-send-mail-from-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/
